Here's my evaluation of the translation you provided:\n\nMajor errors:\n\n1. \"just\" is repeated twice in the translation, which is not necessary and can change the meaning of the sentence. The correct wording should be \"not just\" to emphasize the inclusivity of both boys and girls.\n2. \"our sons\" should be \"our children\" to be more inclusive and accurate, as the sentence is referring to both sons and daughters.\n3. \"but generally in public too\" is not a correct translation of the original Chinese sentence. The phrase \"\u5927\u4f17\" (d\u00e0zh\u00f2u) in Chinese can be translated as \"the public\" or \"the masses,\" but it does not convey the idea of \"in public too.\" A more accurate translation would be \"and include the public as well.\"\n\nHere's the corrected translation:\n\n\"We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls, but for boys and the public as well.\"\n\nNote: The original Chinese sentence is quite long and complex, and the translation may not be perfect. However, the major errors I pointed out above can be improved to make the translation more accurate and natural-sounding."
