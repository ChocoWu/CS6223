The word \"left\" is not necessary in this sentence, as it is implied by the verb \"发现\" (found). Therefore, the sentence should read \"discovered that Tristan had left a warm praise on the homepage of Kohler's photo wall.\"\n2. The word \"another\" is not accurate, as there is only one warm praise mentioned in the sentence. The sentence should read \"discovered that Tristan had left a warm praise on the homepage of Kohler's photo wall.\"\n\nOverall, the translation is quite good, with only two minor errors. The first error is a case of semantic omission, where the word \"left\" is not necessary, and the second error is a case of semantic addition, where the word \"another\" is not accurate."

Grammar swapping: \"和妈妈一起睡\" should be \"and her mother sleeps\" or \"and her mother is sleeping\" to maintain the correct grammatical structure.\n2. Semantic omission: The phrase \"自己周围的环境\" is missing an article \"the\" before \"自己周围的环境\" to indicate that the environment is specific and previously mentioned.\n3. Semantic addition: The phrase \"before resisting\" is not necessary and can be removed to improve the clarity of the sentence.\n\nCorrected translation:\n\nThe youngster, who is healthy and nursing well, can be seen wondering about her enclosure and her mother sleeps with her on a bed of straw"
