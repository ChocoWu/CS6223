Major errors:

1. Grammar swapping: "婴儿连体服" should be "onesie" or "baby jumpsuit" in English.
2. Semantic omission: The phrase "不可战胜" (unconquerable) is not accurately translated as "no-longer-fitting."
3. Semantic addition: The word "jumpsuit" is not present in the original Chinese sentence.

Translation: Meanwhile, Conservative MP and Secretary of State for Business Nadine Zahawi expressed,"Utilizing Jo Cox in this manner is entirely inappropriate, as her family have explicitly requested not to do so. Please stay away from politics."

Major errors:

1. "Utilizing Jo Cox" should be "utilizing Jo Cox's name" or "using Jo Cox's image" to avoid ambiguity and make the sentence more precise.
2. "大错特错" should be "gross error" or "grave mistake" to convey the intended meaning more accurately.

Source: 锁匠被捕，主要监狱安全漏洞令人堪忧。

Translation: and locksmith has been arrested, The the significant security vulnerabilities in the main prison are concerning.

Major errors:

1. "and locksmith" should be "a locksmith" (grammar agreement)
2. "The the" should be "the" (grammar swapping)
3. "significant security vulnerabilities" should be "significant security vulnerabilities in the main prison" (semantic omission)

Suggested corrected translation:

A locksmith has been arrested, and the significant security vulnerabilities in the main prison are concerning.

Explanation:

1. "and locksmith" should be "a locksmith" because "locksmith" is a singular noun, and "and" is not needed in this context.
2. "The the" should be "the" because "the" is already used to modify "prison" in the previous sentence.
3. "significant security vulnerabilities" should be "significant security vulnerabilities in the main prison" to make the sentence more specific and accurate.

Translation: The extended monsoon season bring floods and chaos to many regions of India.

Major errors:

1. Word order: The word order in the translation is not correct. The correct word order should be "brings" instead of "bring" to agree with the subject "extended monsoon season".
2. Semantic omission: The word "many" is omitted in the translation, which is a crucial word to convey the idea that the floods and chaos affect multiple regions.
3. Semantic addition: The word "regions" is added in the translation, which is not present in the source sentence.

Corrected translation: The extended monsoon season brings floods and chaos to many regions of India.

Note: The word "季风" (monsoon) is a noun, and it should be translated as "monsoon season" instead of "extended monsoon season" to be more accurate.

Overall, the translation has some minor errors, but the main issues are the incorrect word order and the lack of certain words that are necessary to convey the correct meaning.

Source: 自最高法院作出暂停大选不合法的裁定以来，这是议会第二次召开会议。

Translation: Since the Supreme Court ruled the suspension of the election as illegal, this is the second time the parliament has convened.

Errors:

1. words: this (error type: semantic omission)
2. words: the (error type: grammatical agreement)

Explanation:

1. The word "this" is missing a verb, and it should be "this is the second time" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
2. The word "the" is in the wrong place and should be changed to "the second time" to improve the sentence's clarity.

Overall, the translation is not bad, but there are a few minor errors that need to be corrected to make the sentence more accurate and natural-sounding.

Major errors:

1. Incorrect word order: The phrase "since they were Both" is not grammatically correct and does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
2. Incorrect preposition: The preposition "since" is not appropriate in this context. A more suitable preposition would be "for" or "during".
3. Incorrect verb tense: The verb "were" is in the past tense, but the context suggests that the abuse is ongoing, so the verb should be in the present tense.

Suggested correction:

Source: 罗布森和塞夫查克均声称，他们小时候就受到杰克逊虐待多年。

Translation: kids Robson and Safechuck claim they have been abused by Jackson for many years.

Note: This correction is based on the assumption that the abuse is ongoing, if the abuse has already stopped, the verb tense should be changed accordingly.

Source: 苏格兰民族党可能支持杰里米·科尔宾出任临时首相，以阻止无协议脱欧。

Translation: The Scottish National Party might interim Jeremy Corbyn as back Prime Minister to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

Major errors:

1. "back" should be "backing" (error type: semantic omission)
2. "interim" should be "interim Prime Minister" (error type: semantic addition)

Suggested corrections:

The Scottish National Party might back Jeremy Corbyn as interim Prime Minister to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

Explanation:

1. "back" is a verb, and "backing" is the correct form to use in this context.
2. "interim" is an adjective, and "interim Prime Minister" is the correct phrase to use to describe the position held by Jeremy Corbyn.

Overall, the translation is quite good, with only two minor errors. The suggested corrections should improve the accuracy and clarity of the translation.

Translation: Hungarian Prime Minister Orbán defends the country's candidate for the European Commission, saying,"I 've got solution a at hand."

Major errors:

2. "解决方案" should be "solution" instead of "resolution" (semantic substitution)

Suggested corrected translation:

Hungarian Prime Minister Orbán defends the country's candidate for the European Commission, saying,"I've got a solution at hand."

Explanation:

1. "手头" (shǒu tóu) is a common error in Chinese-to-English translation, as "head" does not convey the same meaning as "hand" in this context.
2. "解决方案" (jiě jué fāng yì) is a more formal or literary way of saying "solution" in Chinese. In this context, "solution" is a more appropriate choice to convey the meaning of "解决方案" in a more conversational and natural way.

Source: 航空监管机构表示，在星期一启动的和平时期最大规模的遣返行动“马特宏恩计划”中，已经接回了超过 40% 的乘客。

Translation: Aviation regulatory authorities stated that in the largest of repatriation operation"Operation Matterhorn" launched on Monday, over 40 % peacetime passengers have already been brought back.

Errors:

1. "peacetime passengers" should be "passengers during peacetime" or "civilian passengers" to avoid ambiguity.
2. "遣返行动" should be "repatriation operation" or "return operation" to better convey the meaning.
3. "星期一" should be "Monday" for clarity.

Suggestions:

1. Consider using "civilian passengers" to clarify that the operation is focused on bringing back non-combatant travelers.
2. Use "repatriation operation" or "return operation" to better convey the meaning of "遣返行动".
3. Use "Monday" instead of "星期一" for clarity.

Overall, the translation is generally accurate, but could benefit from some minor adjustments to improve clarity and precision.

Errors:

1. words: dude (error type: semantic substitution)
2. words: Carolina North (error type: semantic omission)
3. sentence structure: The sentence structure is not grammatically correct, and the meaning is not clear.

2. "Carolina North" is a place name, and it should be translated as "North Carolina."
3. The sentence structure is not clear, and it needs to be revised to make it grammatically correct and easy to understand.

Overall, the translation needs significant improvement to ensure that it is accurate, clear, and appropriate for the context.

Translation: The school dropped the hammer on students three and kicked off an inquiry into the soccer team's antics.

Major errors:

1. "dropped the hammer" should be "imposed disciplinary measures" or "punished" to be more precise and formal.
2. "kicked off" should be "launched" or "initiated" to be more appropriate for a formal context.
3. "antics" is not a precise or formal term to describe the behavior of a soccer team. It's more suitable for a casual or humorous context.

Source: 又有 15 名税务高官因贪污而退休
Translation: Another 15 big shots in the tax department called it quit from the government, courtesy of corruption.

Major errors:

1. words: big shots (error type: semantic substitution) - The correct phrase should be "high-ranking officials" or "top officials" to convey the same meaning.
2. words: called it quit (error type: semantic omission) - The phrase "called it quit" is not appropriate in this context, as it is a colloquial expression that does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. A more appropriate phrase would be "resigned" or "retired".

Major errors:

1. "rolled into work" should be "arrived at work" or "came to work" to maintain the original meaning of the source sentence.
2. "calls" should be "came" to maintain the original tense of the source sentence.

Translation: He mentioned getting the nod from the current sheriff, Richard Lewis, assuring him that they'll move fast once they wind catch of these screw-ups..

Major errors:

1. "wind catch" should be "wind of" or "catch wind of" to express the idea of becoming aware of something.
2. "screw-ups" is a colloquial expression that may not be appropriate in a formal translation. A more neutral term could be used, such as "mistakes" or "errors."

Suggested corrected translation:

He mentioned getting the nod from the current sheriff, Richard Lewis, assuring him that they'll move fast once they become aware of these mistakes.

Grammar and semantic issues:

1. "得到" (de dao) is a more formal way of saying "get" in Chinese. A more common expression would be "得到" (de yi) or "获得" (gòu de).
2. "迅速行动" (zhù sù xíng dòng) is a bit of a mouthful in English. A more natural way to express the idea would be "take swift action" or "move quickly."

Source: 肉桂由肉桂树的内皮制成，是一种广受欢迎的调料，是各种食品的调味剂，甚至本身已成为一种独特风味。

Translation: Cinnamon is various from the inner bark of the cinnamon tree. It 's a widely loved spice, used to flavor made foods, and has become a unique taste in itself.

Major errors:

1. "various" should be "derived" or "obtained" to accurately convey the meaning of 由 (yù) in Chinese.
2. "inner bark" should be "bark" or "cinnamon bark" to accurately convey the meaning of 内皮 (nèi pí) in Chinese.
3. "flavor made foods" should be "flavored foods" or "foods with flavor" to accurately convey the meaning of 调味 (tiáng wèi) in Chinese.
4. "unique taste" should be "distinct flavor" or "unique flavor" to accurately convey the meaning of 独特风味 (dān tè fēng wèi) in Chinese.

Source: 但我们确信它值得等待。
Translation: wait we 're confident it 's worth the But.

Major errors:

1. Word order: The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be "But we're confident it's worth waiting."
2. Grammar agreement: The verb "worth" is in the wrong tense and should be changed to "is" to agree with the subject "it."
3. Semantic omission: The word "for" is missing, which is necessary to indicate the reason for waiting.

Therefore, the corrected translation should be:

But we're confident it's worth waiting for.

Himiko 's discoverer, Masami Ouchi, a team member from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and the University of Tokyo, mentioned,"It 's possible to finds original star clusters near massive celestial bodies like Himiko. However, what surprises us is that Himiko is not at the center of the original galaxy cluster but on the edge, 500 million light-years away from the center." Ironically, the mythical queen Himiko is said to have lived an isolated life. Ouchi continued,"Currently, it 's unclear why Himiko is n't in the central position. But these results will be crucial information to understand the relationship between galaxy clusters and massive galaxies." [/INST]

Translation: Twenty years later, the world still has n't shaken off the threat of landmines. Prince Harry detonated a newly detected landmine, responding loudly and clearly to his mother's legacy.

Major errors:

1. "摆脱" should be "shaken off" (grammar agreement)

3. "响亮" should be "loudly" (semantic addition)
4. "清晰" should be "clearly" (semantic addition)

Suggested corrected translation: French authorities issued a warning that after the fire is extinguished, it will emit a distinct odor that may spread to nearby areas.

Note: The word "气味" in the source text is a bit ambiguous, as it can be translated as either "odor" or "smell". However, based on the context of the sentence, "odor" might be a more appropriate choice.

Source: 与此同时，向另外两名同样被指控骚扰的学生发出最后警告，并要求他们做出道歉。

Translation: trimembral At the same time, final warnings have been issued to two other students accused of harassment, urging them to make apologies.

Errors:

1. "trimembral" should be "three-member" (error type: semantic substitution)
2. "final warnings" should be "final warnings have been issued" (error type: semantic omission)
3. "urging them to make apologies" should be "urging them to apologize" (error type: semantic addition)

Major errors:

1. "trimembral" is not a word and should be replaced with "three-member" to accurately convey the intended meaning.
2. The phrase "have been issued" is missing after "final warnings" to indicate that the warnings have already been given.
3. The phrase "make apologies" is not necessary and can be simplified to "apologize" to avoid ambiguity.

Overall, the translation is somewhat accurate but contains several errors that need to be corrected.

Translation: Nancy Pelosi's daughter, Christine, becomes the protagonist of a new book.

Errors:

1. words: 成女儿 (error type: semantic omission)
2. words: 新书 (error type: semantic addition)

Explanation:

1. The word "成女儿" (cheng nv er) is not necessary in this sentence, as it is already implied by the phrase "南希·佩洛西的女儿" (Nancy Pelosi's daughter). Omitting this word makes the sentence more concise and natural-sounding.
2. The word "新书" (xin shu) is not accurate, as the word "book" is already implied by "新书主角" (new book protagonist). Using the word "新书" here is a semantic addition, as it is not necessary to specify the type of book.

Overall, the translation is quite good, with only two minor errors. The first error is a semantic omission, and the second error is a semantic addition.

Source: 一名北卡罗莱纳男子在同一次彩票抽奖中抽中五次，包括 163634 美元的头奖。

Translation: A North Carolina man won five times in the same lottery draw, including the top prize of $163,634.

Errors:

1. "包括" should be translated as "including" or "with" instead of "包含" (error type: semantic omission)
2. "头奖" should be translated as "top prize" or "first prize" instead of "head prize" (error type: semantic substitution)

So the corrected translation should be:

A North Carolina man won five times in the same lottery draw, including the top prize of $163,634.

Note: There are no major errors in this translation.

Source: 虽然女孩一再央求男子住手，但男子依然用手锁住了她的脖子，硬将她拖进灌木丛。

Translation: Despite the girl repeatedly begging the man to stop, he still used his hands to grab her and forcefully dragged her into the bushes.

Major errors:

1. "hands" should be "hand" (grammar agreement)
2. "grab" should be "grabbed" (past tense agreement)
3. "forcefully" should be "forcibly" (semantic substitution)
4. "dragged" should be "dragging" (present participle agreement)

Corrected translation: Despite the girl repeatedly begging the man to stop, he still used his hand to grab her and forcibly dragged her into the bushes.

Note: There is also a semantic omission in the original sentence, as the verb "央求" ( begging) is not explicitly stated. However, it is implied by the context, so it is not a major error.

Errors:

1. words: two (error type: semantic omission)
2. words: department (error type: semantic addition)

Explanation:

1. The word "two" is omitted in the translation, which should be included to maintain the correct count of the number of police officers being referred to.
2. The word "department" is added to the translation, which is not present in the original source. The correct word should be "policies" to maintain the correct meaning.

Overall, the translation is relatively accurate, but the two errors mentioned above should be corrected to improve the quality of the translation.

Translation: UK government regulatory agencies state that if there is a "no-deal Brexit," the government still needs to complete "a significant amount" of work to ensure an adequate supply of medicines in the country.

Major errors:

1. "preform" should be "perform" (error type: actual translation error)

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Use "significant amount" instead of "大量" to maintain the original meaning and avoid any potential semantic ambiguity.

Therefore, the corrected translation could be:

UK government regulatory agencies state that if there is a "no-deal Brexit," the government still needs to perform a significant amount of work to ensure an adequate supply of medicines in the country.

Source: 有人发现特里斯坦在科勒的照片墙主页上留下了另一段热情的赞美之词。

Translation: discovered that Tristan left another warm praise on the homepage of Kohler 's photo wall.

Errors:

1. words: left (error type: semantic omission)
2. words: another (error type: semantic addition)

Explanation:

1. The word "left" is not necessary in this sentence, as it is implied by the verb "发现" (found). Therefore, the sentence should read "discovered that Tristan had left a warm praise on the homepage of Kohler's photo wall."
2. The word "another" is not accurate, as there is only one warm praise mentioned in the sentence. The sentence should read "discovered that Tristan had left a warm praise on the homepage of Kohler's photo wall."

Overall, the translation is quite good, with only two minor errors. The first error is a case of semantic omission, where the word "left" is not necessary, and the second error is a case of semantic addition, where the word "another" is not accurate.

Translation: Meyers stated,"This is the President 's consistent tone. What surprises me is that his presidential office desk is not inundated with unreturned Blockbuster atonicity."

Major errors:

1. "Blockbuster atonicity" should be "Blockbuster DVDs" or "DVDs from Blockbuster" to maintain the correct meaning and avoid confusion.
2. "总统办公室办公桌上" should be "his presidential office desk" or "his desk in the presidential office" to improve clarity and accuracy.

Translation: cooperation and field athletes participating in indoor competitions state that the impact of high temperatures on their performance should not be significant, but they also acknowledge that training is particularly exhausting.

Major errors:

Source: 由好莱坞重量级经纪人阿里·伊曼纽尔支持的娱乐及人才经纪公司 Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N) 因市场形势严峻，在最后一刻决定放弃首次公开募股，该公司过去曾有过亏损记录。2019 年早些时候，约车公司优步科技 (UBER.N) 和 Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) 还没有明确的盈利时间表，吸取了这两家公司的教训，投资者已经开始推迟投资那些有严重亏损历史的公司。“这将是银行家、董事会和高级管理团队之间的对话，他们会说，‘这些是孤立的，不可比较的'，或者说，‘我们的情绪发生了转变，我们需要更加保守，并使用不同的战略'”，普华永道会计师事务所美国首次公开募股服务主管的大卫·埃思里奇说道。市场更容易接纳一些不太知名的公司，比如网络安全公司 Ping Identity (PING.N) 和云监测公司 Datadog Inc (DDOG.O)。这两家公司的亏损都较为温和，而且主要是向公司而非消费者销售产品。
Translation: Endeavor Group Holdings, an entertainment and talent agency supported by heavyweight Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel, decided to abandon its initial public offering at the last minute due to challenging market conditions and its past loss records. Earlier in 2019, ride-sharing companies Uber Technologies ( UBER.N ) and Lyft Inc ( LYFT.O ) had no clear timetable, and investors, having learned from the lessons of these two companies, began to delay investments in companies with a history of severe losses."This will be a conversation between bankers, boards, and senior management, where they will say, 'These are isolated, not comparable, ' or say, 'Our sentiment has shifted, we need to be more conservative and use different strategies, '" said David Ethridge, PwC 's U.S. IPO Services Leader. The market is more accepting of less-known companies, such as cybersecurity firm Ping Identity ( PING.N ) and cloud monitoring company Datadog Inc ( DDOG.O ). Both companies ' losses are relatively moderate, and they primarily sell products to businesses rather than consumers. [/INST]

Translation: However, insists that he is just doing his job.

Errors:

1. words: 坚持 (error type: semantic omission)
2. words: 本职 (error type: semantic substitution)

Explanation:

1. The word "坚持" (jiān chí) is missing in the translation. The correct translation should be "However, he insists that he is just doing his job."
2. The word "本职" (ben zhí) is a semantic substitution error. The correct translation should be "his job."

Overall, the translation is fairly accurate, but there are two minor errors that need to be corrected.

Translation: A senior official from the Trump administration admitted on Friday that the House lawyer instructed the transfer of President Trump's July phone records with Ukrainian President Zelensky to a highly secure system.

Errors:

1. words: 特朗普 (error type: semantic omission) - The word "特朗普" should be translated as "Trump" instead of "President Trump" to make the sentence more concise.

Source: 如果他出任首相，他已经为重新举行 2014 年公投打开了大门。

Translation: If he becomes the prime minister, he already opened the door to holding the 2014 referendum again.

Errors:

1. "重新举行" should be "to hold again" or "to repeat" instead of "重新举行" which is a literal translation but not the most appropriate one in this context.
2. "大门" should be "the door" instead of "大门" which is a more formal way of saying "door".

So, the corrected translation should be:

Translation: If he becomes the prime minister, he has already opened the door to holding the 2014 referendum again.

Note: There is no major error in this translation, but the phrase "重新举行" could be improved for better clarity and accuracy.

Source: 安德鲁和我都是最幸运的人，因为我们有两个很棒的女婿。
Translation: and I are both the luckiest people because we have two fantastic sons-in-law.

Major errors:

1. Word order: The word order in the translation is not the same as the word order in the source sentence. In the source sentence, the subject "安德鲁和我" (Andrew and I) comes before the verb "都是", while in the translation, the subject "和我" (and I) comes after the verb "are". This is a grammatical error.
2. Pronoun agreement: The pronoun "我们" (we) in the source sentence does not agree with the subject "安德鲁和我" (Andrew and I). The pronoun should be "我" (I) to agree with the subject.
3. Semantic omission: The phrase "因为" (because) in the source sentence is not translated in the translation. This is a semantic omission.

Minor errors:

1. Word choice: The word "很棒" (very good) in the source sentence is not the most appropriate word choice for "sons-in-law". A more appropriate word choice would be "two excellent sons-in-law".
2. Punctuation: The sentence in the translation does not have a period at the end, which is a punctuation error.

Overall, the translation has several major and minor errors that affect the accuracy and fluency of the translation. To improve the translation, the translator should pay closer attention to word order, pronoun agreement, and semantic omission, and use more appropriate word choices and punctuation

Here is a demonstration:    
Source: 设立新的奖项计划是为了表彰那些礼貌得体的政治人士。
Translation: The Wednesday establishment of a new award programs is to recognize those polite and well-mannered figures political.
Output: 
(1) words: programs (error type: grammar agreement)
(2) words: figures --- political (error type: grammar swapping)
(3) words: Wednesday (error type: semantic addition)

Now, please give your evaluation for the following translations:

Source: 德国报道发生西尰罗河病毒标志性病例
Translation: Germany a landmark case of West Nile virus.

Major errors:

1. Word order: The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be "Germany has reported a landmark case of West Nile virus."
2. Grammar agreement: The word "case" is in the singular form, but the subject "Germany" is in the plural form. The correct form should be "Germany has reported a landmark case of West Nile virus."
3. Semantic omission: The phrase "West Nile virus" is missing in the translation.

So, the corrected translation should be:

Germany has reported a landmark case of West Nile virus.

Note: I didn't provide modified sentences, as you requested. Instead, I listed the errors and corrected them to help you understand where the translation went wrong.

Major errors:

1. "措施" not translated (error type: semantic omission)
2. "等援助" not translated (error type: grammar swapping)

Overall, the translation is good, but there are some minor errors that need to be corrected. The major errors are the non-translation of "措施" and "等援助".

Source: 安东尼奥·布朗宣称还未做好退役准备
Translation: Antonio Brown claims he 's not ready to retire yet, because who needs retirement when you 've got?

Major errors:

1. Grammar agreement: The word "claims" should be in the third person singular form "claims" instead of the third person plural form "claim" to agree with the subject "Antonio Brown."
2. Semantic omission: The phrase "because who needs retirement when you 've got" is not grammatically correct and does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. The phrase "because he has not made sufficient preparations for retirement" or a similar phrase should be used instead.

Corrected translation:
Antonio Brown claims he is not ready to retire yet because he has not made sufficient preparations for retirement.

Note: The word "got" is not a suitable translation for the Chinese word "有" (yǒu) in this context. "有" is a verb meaning "to have" or "to possess," and it is not appropriate to use it to translate "got" in this sentence.

Additionally, the phrase "ungraved" is not a word and should be corrected to "ungraded".

Errors:

1. words: stealer (error type: semantic substitution)

Explanation:

1. "stealer" should be "bringer" or "provider" to maintain the correct meaning of the original sentence.

2. "Guy Alford" should be "Guy Alford's" to indicate possession.
3. "lamented" is not the best choice of word to convey the meaning of the original Chinese sentence. A more appropriate word would be "said" or "uttered".

Source: 该区是澳大利亚第一个承认动物感知能力的管辖区。

Translation: This area proudly wears the badge of Australia campanilla 's first jurisdiction to acknowledge the psychic abilities of animals. Yes, even the kangaroos are in on it.

Major errors:

1. Grammar swapping: "承认动物感知能力" should be "acknowledge the psychic abilities of animals" instead.
2. Semantic addition: The phrase "Yes, even the kangaroos are in on it" is not present in the original source and seems to be an added interpretation.

Overall, the translation is not accurate and contains some creative liberties that are not present in the original source. The grammar and word choice are also not consistent with the original source.

2. " Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge" should be "Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge" (semantic omission)

Major errors:

1. "in along with" is not a correct phrase and can be misleading. It should be "along with" to convey the correct meaning.
2. "Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge" should be a single phrase, not two separate phrases.

Suggestions:

1. Use "along with" instead of "in along with" to convey the correct meaning.
2. Combine "Prince William and Kate" into a single phrase to improve clarity and consistency.

Here's the corrected translation:

This celebrity attended the naming ceremony at the Birkenhead Cammell Laird shipyard along with Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge.

Translation: Michelle Obama added,"meeting leaders with our Obama Foundation @ ObamaFoundation or helping girls worldwide seek education, she has inspired many."

Suggested corrections:

1. Grammar agreement: "meeting with our Obama Foundation leaders"

Source: 托马斯·库克养老金受托人策划支出挽救协议

Translation: Thomas Cook pension trustees plot deal to salvage puddings

Major errors:

1. Words: puddings (error type: semantic substitution)

Explanation: The word "puddings" does not accurately convey the meaning of the original Chinese phrase "挽救协议" (puddings are a type of dessert, while the phrase refers to a rescue or bailout agreement).

2. Words: plot (error type: semantic ambiguity)

Explanation: The word "plot" can have multiple meanings, including a secret plan or scheme, but it is not the most appropriate word to use in this context. A more suitable word would be "negotiate" or "draft" to convey the idea of the trustees working together to salvage the pension fund.

Overall, the translation is not accurate and does not convey the intended meaning of the original Chinese sentence.

Translation: The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent increase.

Major errors:

Translation: Initially, the search engine was called "BackRub" and it was later renamed "Banana."

Major errors:

1. words: BackRub (error type: semantic substitution)
2. words: Banana (error type: semantic omission)

Explanation:

1. "BackRub" should be translated as "Google" instead of "BackRub" because "BackRub" is the original name of the search engine, and it has been renamed to "Google" later on.
2. "Banana" should not be included in the translation at all, as it is not a correct name of the search engine.

Overall, the translation has two major errors, one of which is a semantic substitution and the other is a semantic omission. To improve the translation, the translator should have researched the correct name of the search engine and used it in the translation.
