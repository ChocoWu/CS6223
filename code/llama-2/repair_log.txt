Source: 香港警方称抗议活动中学生被捕人数增加
Translation: student Kong police say Hong arrests at protests increase
Given the source sentence and translation, the following errors are detected in the translation:
1. Word order: The translation should be "Hong Kong police say number of students arrested at protests increases" instead of "student Kong police say Hong arrests at protests increase." The word order is incorrect, and the phrase "at protests" should be moved to the end of the sentence.
2. Grammar: The word "student" is not plural, so it should be "students" instead.
3. Semantic accuracy: The translation should be more specific and accurate. Instead of using the vague phrase "protests," it would be better to use "demonstrations" or "anti-government rallies" to convey the specific type of events that the students are participating in.
Your task is to rectify translation based on the detected errors, and output the modified translation. [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the modified translation based on the detected errors:

Source: 香港警方称抗议活动中学生被捕人数增加
Translation: Hong Kong police say number of students arrested at anti-government rallies increases

Here's the breakdown of the changes I made:

1. Word order: I moved the phrase "at protests" to the end of the sentence, as you suggested. This makes the sentence flow better and is more idiomatic in English.
2. Grammar: I changed "student" to "students" to make the sentence plural, as you pointed out.
3. Semantic accuracy: I replaced the vague phrase "protests" with "anti-government rallies" to make the translation more specific and accurate. This better conveys the type of events that the students are participating in.

I hope this modified translation meets your needs! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with.

Source: 但我们确信它值得等待。
Translation: But we are confident it's worth the wait.

Explanation:

* "但" (dàn) is a particle that indicates a contrast or a contradiction. In this sentence, it is used to indicate that there is a difference of opinion or a disagreement.
* "我们" (wǒmen) is the first-person plural pronoun, meaning "we".
* "确信" (qíxìn) is a verb that means "to be confident" or "to be certain". In this sentence, it is used to indicate that the speaker is confident about something.
* "它" (tā) is a pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is "wait".
* "值得" (zhíde) is a phrase that means "worth" or "deserving". In this sentence, it is used to indicate that the thing being referred to is worth the wait.
* "等待" (děngdài) is a verb that means "to wait" or "to await". In this sentence, it is used to indicate that the speaker is waiting for something.

So, the corrected translation of the sentence is: "But we are confident it's worth the wait."

Translation: U.S. President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor on Thursday to in the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ), the White House said head a statement.
Given the source sentence and translation, the following errors are detected in the translation:
1. Words: Thursday (error type: semantic addition)
2. Words: head (error type: grammar swapping)
1. Thursday is not necessary in the sentence, as the action of nominating took place on that day. Therefore, it should be omitted.

2. Grammar: "in ' all areas" should be "in all areas" to correct the grammar agreement issue.

Explanation:

1. Word choice: "branded" is a stronger word than "labeled" or "tagged", and it can convey a more negative connotation. In this case, "labeled" or "tagged" would be a more appropriate choice to convey the idea that the police department has been found lacking in certain areas.
2. Grammar: "in ' all areas" should be "in all areas" to correct the grammar agreement issue.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

* "发生" (fāshēng) should be translated as "has reported" instead of "a landmark case" to make the sentence more accurate and natural.
* "标志性" (biāozhìxìng) is not a commonly used word in English, and "landmark" is a more appropriate translation.

So the corrected translation is: Germany has reported a landmark case of West Nile virus.

Source: 如果他出任首相，他已经为重新举行 2014 年公投打开了大门。
Translation: If he becomes the prime minister, he already opened the door to holding the 2014 referendum again.
Given the source sentence and translation, the following errors are detected in the translation:
1. Word order: The word order in the translation is incorrect. The correct word order should be "if he becomes the prime minister, he has already opened the door to holding the 2014 referendum again."
2. Grammar: The verb tense in the translation is inconsistent. The verb "has already" is in the past perfect tense, but the verb "opened" is in the simple past tense. The correct verb tense should be consistent throughout the sentence.
3. Semantics: The word "again" is not necessary in the translation, as the referendum has already been held.
Your task is to rectify translation based on the detected errors, and output the modified translation. [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the modified translation based on the detected errors:

If he becomes the prime minister, he has already opened the door to holding the 2014 referendum.

Here's a breakdown of the changes I made:

1. Word order: I changed the word order to make the sentence more natural and clear.
2. Grammar: I changed the verb tense to be consistent throughout the sentence. Since "has already" is in the past perfect tense, I changed "opened" to the past perfect tense as well.
3. Semantics: I removed the word "again" since the referendum has already been held.

I hope this modified translation better reflects the intended meaning of the source sentence!

Source: 如果他出任首相，他已经为重新举行 2014 年公投打开了大门。
Translation: If he becomes the prime minister, he has already opened the door to re-holding the 2014 referendum.

Explanation:

* "重新举行" (zhòng xīn jīn gōng) means "to re-hold" or "to hold again".
* "大门" (dà mén) means "the door".

So the correct translation should be "he has already opened the door to re-holding the 2014 referendum", instead of "he already opened the door to holding the 2014 referendum again".

Source: 托马斯·库克深陷破产引发了一场激烈的指责游戏，董事会成员、政府部长和审计人员都需要对集团破产前几个月各自的行为进行解释。

Translation: Thomas Cook's descent into insolvency has sparked a bitter blame game, with board members, government ministers, and auditors all facing demands to explain their actions in the months before its collapse.

The errors in the original translation are:

1. "unarmored" should be "unaware" (不知情) instead of "unarmed" (无武装).
2. "各自" should be "各自的" (each person's) instead of "各自" (each one).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Translation: 'Stella is the sixth Newichawanoc youngster from Nancy and Ruby and our bull, Monty, has proved to be an excellent dad.
Given the source sentence and translation, the following errors are detected in the translation:
1. Words: youngster (error type: semantic inappropriateness)
2. Words: Newichawanoc (error type: unfamiliar term)
3. Sentence structure: The sentence structure is not natural and sounds awkward.
1. "Youngster" is not an appropriate term to use to describe a child. It is more commonly used to describe a teenager or someone who is young at heart.
2. "Newichawanoc" is not a word in English. It seems to be a made-up term that doesn't have any meaning.
3. The sentence structure is not natural because it uses a series of nouns without any connecting verbs. It would be more natural to use "and" or "but" to connect the clauses.

Source: "斯特拉是南希和鲁比家的第六个孩子，我们的公牛蒙蒂已经被证明是一个出色的父亲。"

Translation: "Stella is the sixth child of Nancy and Ruby, and our bull, Monty, has proven to be an excellent father."

Here's the breakdown of the errors and the changes made:

1. "Youngster" is not an appropriate term to use to describe a child. It is more commonly used to describe a teenager or someone who is young at heart.

Solution: Change "youngster" to "child" to make the sentence more natural and accurate.

2. "Newichawanoc" is not a word in English. It seems to be a made-up term that doesn't have any meaning.

Solution: Remove the word "Newichawanoc" altogether, as it doesn't contribute any meaning to the sentence.

3. The sentence structure is not natural because it uses a series of nouns without any connecting verbs. It would be more natural to use "and" or "but" to connect the clauses.

Solution: Add a conjunction (in this case, "and") to connect the two clauses.

I hope this modified translation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
