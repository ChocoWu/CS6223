Russia is also hampering shipping in the region and last year captured three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait."
可能会引起口腔溃疡——摄入过多肉桂不仅会引发致命的状况，还会引起口腔溃疡。据推测，这是因为肉桂中含有肉桂醛，而肉桂醛是一种大量摄入后会导致人体过敏反应的化合物。但是，只有对肉桂醛过敏的人才可能患口腔溃疡。,"May cause mouth sores - Not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth sores.

在目前的宇宙中，星系团可以包含数百个星系，但这些星系团是如何形成的在天文领域仍是一大疑问。为了了解星系团的形成，天文学家寻找古代宇宙中可能的起源。原星系团是早期宇宙中由数十个星系组成的稠密系统，并逐渐形成一个星系团。,"In the present Universe, galaxy clusters can contain hundreds of members, but how these clusters form is a big question in astronomy.

只要德·格罗德继续服药，再犯罪的风险就不会很大，那么人们为什么这么担心呢？我认为，人们对精神病患者，特别是精神分裂症患者的污名，很大程度上导致了这种恐惧。某些精神疾病已经变得不那么可怕了，比如情绪和焦虑障碍。但其他疾病，包括精神分裂症，仍然被高度污名化。这在很大程度上是因为许多人把精神分裂症患者描绘成危险人物，他们的脑袋里有声音告诉他们要杀人。,"As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned? I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear. Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders. But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized. This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people."

首先，让我们看看较为悲观的一面。德·格罗德确实在精神病发作期间捅死了 5 个人。这是一次不可预测的暴力袭击。他患有精神分裂症，这就是为什么他被裁定不负刑事责任，但此后一直在看精神病医生和服用药物。他的精神科医生桑托克·雷曾在审查委员会面前表示，“如果马修·德·格罗德再次犯法，那将后果严重。” 尽管他感觉有进步，但仍有再次攻击他人的风险。但这个理由足以令人继续害怕吗？这个理由足够把德格罗德关起来吗？,"First, let's examine the more pessimistic side. De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break. It was a violent and unpredictable attack. He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication. His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that ""if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe."" Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense. But is this reason enough to remain afraid? Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?"
