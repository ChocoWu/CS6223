Russia is also hampering shipping in the region and last year captured three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait."
可能会引起口腔溃疡——摄入过多肉桂不仅会引发致命的状况，还会引起口腔溃疡。据推测，这是因为肉桂中含有肉桂醛，而肉桂醛是一种大量摄入后会导致人体过敏反应的化合物。但是，只有对肉桂醛过敏的人才可能患口腔溃疡。,"May cause mouth sores - Not only does too much cinnamon help contribute to deadly conditions but they may also cause mouth sores.
