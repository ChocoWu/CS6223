## Data Processing

- Data Source: We take the ***WMT-20*** as the source data.
- Random sampling ***400*** instances for testing, which is saved in `data/sample_400.csv`. 
  - Then, we employ the first ***200*** instances (`data/sample_200_for_llm.csv`) for testing LLM-based translation.
  - The rest ***200*** instances (`data/sample_200_for_gold.csv`) are taken as gold translation from Translator (e.g., Google Translator).
